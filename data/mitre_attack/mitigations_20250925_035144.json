Develop a robust cyber threat intelligence capability to determine what types and levels of threat may use software exploits and 0-days against a particular organization. Make it difficult for adversaries to advance their operation through exploitation of undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities by using sandboxing, if available. Other types of virtualization and application microsegmentation may also mitigate the impact of some types of exploitation. The risks of additional exploits and weaknesses in implementation may still exist.

Make it difficult for adversaries to advance their operation through exploitation of undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities by using sandboxing, if available. Other types of virtualization and application microsegmentation may also mitigate the impact of some types of exploitation. The risks of additional exploits and weaknesses in implementation may still exist. (Citation: Ars Technica Pwn2Own 2017 VM Escape)\n\nSecurity applications that look for behavior used during exploitation such as Windows Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG) and the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to mitigate some exploitation behavior. (Citation: TechNet Moving Beyond EMET) Control flow integrity checking is another way to potentially identify and stop a software exploit from occurring. (Citation: Wikipedia Control Flow Integrity) Many of these protections depend on the architecture and target application binary for compatibility and may not work for all software or services targeted.",

    "name": "Vulnerability Scanning",
    "description": "Vulnerability scanning involves the automated or manual assessment of systems, applications, and networks to identify misconfigurations, unpatched software, or other security weaknesses. The process helps prioritize remediation efforts by classifying vulnerabilities based on risk and impact, reducing the likelihood of exploitation by adversaries. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: \n\nProactive Identification of Vulnerabilities\n\n- Implementation: Use tools like Nessus or OpenVAS to scan endpoints, servers, and applications for missing patches and configuration issues. Schedule regular scans to ensure timely identification of vulnerabilities introduced by new deployments or updates.\n- Use Case: A scan identifies unpatched software, such as outdated Apache servers, which could be exploited via CVE-XXXX-XXXX. The server is promptly patched, mitigating the risk.\n\nCloud Environment Scanning\n\n- Implementation: Use cloud-specific vulnerability management tools like AWS Inspector, Azure Security Center, or GCP Security Command Center to identify issues like open S3 buckets or overly permissive IAM roles.\n- Use Case: The scan detects a misconfigured S3 bucket with public read access, which is remediated to prevent potential data leakage.\n\nNetwork Device Scanning\n\n- Implementation: Use tools to scan network devices for vulnerabilities, such as weak SNMP strings or outdated firmware. Correlate scan results with vendor advisories to prioritize updates.\n- Use Case: Scanning detects a router running outdated firmware vulnerable to CVE-XXXX-YYYY. The firmware is updated to a secure version.\n\nWeb Application Scanning\n\n- Implementation: Use dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools such as OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to scan for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). Perform regular scans post-deployment to identify newly introduced vulnerabilities.\n- Use Case: A scan identifies a cross-site scripting vulnerability in a form input field, which is promptly remediated by developers.\n\nPrioritizing Vulnerabilities\n\n- Implementation: Use vulnerability scoring frameworks like CVSS to assess severity.\nIntegrate vulnerability scanning tools with ticketing systems to assign remediation tasks based on criticality.\n- Use Case: A critical vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.8 affecting remote access servers is prioritized and patched first.\n\n*Tools for Implementation*\n\nOpen Source Tools:\n\n- OpenVAS: Comprehensive network and system vulnerability scanning.\n- OWASP ZAP: Dynamic scanning of web applications for vulnerabilities.\n- Nmap with NSE Scripts: Network scanning with scripts to detect vulnerabilities.",

Signatures are often for unique indicators within protocols and may be based on the specific obfuscation technique used by a particular adversary or tool, and will likely be different across various malware families and versions. Adversaries will likely change tool command and control signatures over time or construct protocols in such a way to avoid detection by common defensive tools.

This can include employing technologies like network concentrators, RDP gateways, and zero-trust network access (ZTNA) models, alongside hardening services and protocols. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nAudit and Restrict Access:\n\n- Regularly audit permissions for file shares, network services, and remote access tools.\n- Remove unnecessary access and enforce least privilege principles for users and services.\n- Use Active Directory and IAM tools to restrict access based on roles and attributes.\n\nDeploy Secure Remote Access Solutions:\n\n- Use RDP gateways, VPN concentrators, and ZTNA solutions to aggregate and secure remote access connections.\n- Configure access controls to restrict connections based on time, device, and user identity.\n- Enforce MFA for all remote access mechanisms.\n\nDisable Unnecessary Services:\n\n- Identify running services using tools like netstat (Windows/Linux) or Nmap.\n- Disable unused services, such as Telnet, FTP, and legacy SMB, to reduce the attack surface.\n- Use firewall rules to block traffic on unused ports and protocols.\n\nNetwork Segmentation and Isolation:\n\n- Use VLANs, firewalls, or micro-segmentation to isolate critical network resources from general access.\n- Restrict communication between subnets to prevent lateral movement.\n\nMonitor and Log Access:\n\n- Monitor access attempts to file shares, RDP, and remote network resources using SIEM tools.\n- Enable auditing and logging for successful and failed attempts to access restricted resources.\n\n*Tools for Implementation*\n\nFile Share Management:\n\n- Microsoft Active Directory Group Policies\n- Samba (Linux/Unix file share management)\n- AccessEnum (Windows access auditing tool)\n\nSecure Remote Access:\n\n- Microsoft Remote Desktop Gateway\n- Apache Guacamole (open-source RDP/VNC gateway)\n- Zero Trust solutions: Tailscale, Cloudflare Zero Trust\n\nService and Protocol Hardening:\n\n- Nmap or Nessus for network service discovery\n- Windows Group Policy Editor for disabling SMBv1, Telnet, and legacy protocols\n- iptables or firewalld (Linux) for blocking unnecessary traffic\n\nNetwork Segmentation:\n\n- pfSense for open-source network isolation",

    "description": "Application Developer Guidance focuses on providing developers with the knowledge, tools, and best practices needed to write secure code, reduce vulnerabilities, and implement secure design principles. By integrating security throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), this mitigation aims to prevent the introduction of exploitable weaknesses in applications, systems, and APIs. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n \nPreventing SQL Injection (Secure Coding Practice):\n\n- Implementation: Train developers to use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of directly embedding user input into SQL queries.\n- Use Case: A web application accepts user input to search a database. By sanitizing and validating user inputs, developers can prevent attackers from injecting malicious SQL commands.\n\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) Mitigation:\n\n- Implementation: Require developers to implement output encoding for all user-generated content displayed on a web page.\n- Use Case: An e-commerce site allows users to leave product reviews. Properly encoding and escaping user inputs prevents malicious scripts from being executed in other users\u2019 browsers.\n\nSecure API Design:\n\n- Implementation: Train developers to authenticate all API endpoints and avoid exposing sensitive information in API responses.\n- Use Case: A mobile banking application uses APIs for account management. By enforcing token-based authentication for every API call, developers reduce the risk of unauthorized access.\n\nStatic Code Analysis in the Build Pipeline:\n\n- Implementation: Incorporate tools into CI/CD pipelines to automatically scan for vulnerabilities during the build process.\n- Use Case: A fintech company integrates static analysis tools to detect hardcoded credentials in their source code before deployment.\n\nThreat Modeling in the Design Phase:\n\n- Implementation: Use frameworks like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to assess threats during application design.\n- Use Case: Before launching a customer portal, a SaaS company identifies potential abuse cases, such as session hijacking, and designs mitigations like secure session management.\n\n**Tools for Implementation**:\n\n- Static Code Analysis Tools: Use tools that can scan for known vulnerabilities in source code.\n- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Use tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to simulate runtime attacks and identify vulnerabilities.\n- Secure Frameworks: Recommend secure-by-default frameworks (e.g., Django for Python, Spring Security for Java) that enforce security best practices.",

UAC prompts users to confirm or provide administrator credentials when an action requires elevated privileges. Proper configuration of UAC reduces the risk of privilege escalation attacks. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nEnable UAC Globally:\n\n- Ensure UAC is enabled through Group Policy by setting `User Account Control: Run all administrators in Admin Approval Mode` to `Enabled`.\n\nRequire Credential Prompt:\n\n- Use Group Policy to configure UAC to prompt for administrative credentials instead of just confirmation (`User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt`).\n\nRestrict Built-in Administrator Account:\n\nSet `Admin Approval Mode` for the built-in Administrator account to `Enabled` in Group Policy.\n\nSecure the UAC Prompt:\n\n- Configure UAC prompts to display on the secure desktop (`User Account Control: Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation`).\n\nPrevent UAC Bypass:\n\n- Block untrusted applications from triggering UAC prompts by configuring `User Account Control: Only elevate executables that are signed and validated`.\n- Use EDR tools to detect and block known UAC bypass techniques.\n\nMonitor UAC-Related Events:\n\n- Use Windows Event Viewer to monitor for event ID 4688 (process creation) and look for suspicious processes attempting to invoke UAC elevation.\n\n*Tools for Implementation*\n\nBuilt-in Windows Tools:\n\n- Group Policy Editor: Configure UAC settings centrally for enterprise environments.\n- Registry Editor: Modify UAC-related settings directly, such as `EnableLUA` and `ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin`.\n\nEndpoint Security Solutions:\n\n- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint: Detects and blocks UAC bypass techniques.\n- Sysmon: Logs process creations and monitors UAC elevation attempts for suspicious activity.\n\nThird-Party Security Tools:\n\n- Process Monitor (Sysinternals): Tracks real-time processes interacting with UAC.\n- EventSentry: Monitors Windows Event Logs for UAC-related alerts.",

Other types of virtualization and application microsegmentation may also mitigate the impact of some types of exploitation. The risks of additional exploits and weaknesses in implementation may still exist.

    "description": "This technique may be difficult to mitigate since the domains can be registered just before they are used, and disposed shortly after. Malware researchers can reverse-engineer malware variants that use DGAs and determine future domains that the malware will attempt to contact, but this is a time and resource intensive effort.(Citation: Cybereason Dissecting DGAs)(Citation: Cisco Umbrella DGA Brute Force) Malware is also increasingly incorporating seed values that can be unique for each instance, which would then need to be determined to extract future generated domains. In some cases, the seed that a particular sample uses can be extracted from DNS traffic.(Citation: Akamai DGA Mitigation) Even so, there can be thousands of possible domains generated per day; this makes it impractical for defenders to preemptively register all possible C2 domains due to the cost. In some cases a local DNS sinkhole may be used to help prevent DGA-based command and control at a reduced cost.\n\nNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level. Signatures are often for unique indicators within protocols and may be based on the specific protocol used by a particular adversary or tool, and will likely be different across various malware families and versions.

This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nRegular Backup Scheduling:\n- Use Case: Ensure timely and consistent backups of critical data.\n- Implementation: Schedule daily incremental backups and weekly full backups for all critical servers and systems.\n\nImmutable Backups:\n- Use Case: Protect backups from modification or deletion, even by attackers.\n- Implementation: Use write-once-read-many (WORM) storage for backups, preventing ransomware from encrypting or deleting backup files.\n\nBackup Encryption:\n- Use Case: Protect data integrity and confidentiality during transit and storage.\n- Implementation: Encrypt backups using strong encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256) before storing them in local, cloud, or remote locations.\n\nOffsite Backup Storage:\n- Use Case: Ensure data availability during physical disasters or onsite breaches.\n- Implementation: Use cloud-based solutions like AWS S3, Azure Backup, or physical offsite storage to maintain a copy of critical data.\n\nBackup Testing:\n- Use Case: Validate backup integrity and ensure recoverability.\n- Implementation: Regularly test data restoration processes to ensure that backups are not corrupted and can be recovered quickly.",

This ensures that only trusted and authorized code is executed, reducing the risk of malware and unauthorized actions. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nApplication Control:\n\n- Use Case: Use tools like AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) to create whitelists of authorized applications and block unauthorized ones. On Linux, use tools like SELinux or AppArmor to define mandatory access control policies for application execution.\n- Implementation: Allow only digitally signed or pre-approved applications to execute on servers and endpoints. (e.g., `New-AppLockerPolicy -PolicyType Enforced -FilePath \"C:\\Policies\\AppLocker.xml\"`) \n\n\nScript Blocking:\n\n- Use Case: Use script control mechanisms to block unauthorized execution of scripts, such as PowerShell or JavaScript. Web Browsers: Use browser extensions or settings to block JavaScript execution from untrusted sources.\n- Implementation: Configure PowerShell to enforce Constrained Language Mode for non-administrator users. (e.g., `Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned`) \n\nExecutable Blocking:\n\n- Use Case: Prevent execution of binaries from suspicious locations, such as `%TEMP%` or `%APPDATA%` directories.\n- Implementation: Block execution of `.exe`, `.bat`, or `.ps1` files from user-writable directories.\n\nDynamic Analysis Prevention:\n- Use Case: Use behavior-based execution prevention tools to identify and block malicious activity in real time.\n- Implemenation: Employ EDR solutions that analyze runtime behavior and block suspicious code execution.",

    "name": "Code Signing",
    "description": "Code Signing is a security process that ensures the authenticity and integrity of software by digitally signing executables, scripts, and other code artifacts. It prevents untrusted or malicious code from executing by verifying the digital signatures against trusted sources. Code signing protects against tampering, impersonation, and distribution of unauthorized or malicious software, forming a critical defense against supply chain and software exploitation attacks. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nEnforce Signed Code Execution:\n\n- Implementation: Configure operating systems (e.g., Windows with AppLocker or Linux with Secure Boot) to allow only signed code to execute.\n- Use Case: Prevent the execution of malicious PowerShell scripts by requiring all scripts to be signed with a trusted certificate.\n\nVendor-Signed Driver Enforcement:\n\n- Implementation: Enable kernel-mode code signing to ensure that only drivers signed by trusted vendors can be loaded.\n- Use Case: A malicious driver attempting to modify system memory fails to load because it lacks a valid signature.\n\nCertificate Revocation Management:\n\n- Implementation: Use Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) or Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) to block certificates associated with compromised or deprecated code.\n- Use Case: A compromised certificate used to sign a malicious update is revoked, preventing further execution of the software.\n\nThird-Party Software Verification:\n\n- Implementation: Require software from external vendors to be signed with valid certificates before deployment.\n- Use Case: An organization only deploys signed and verified third-party software to prevent supply chain attacks.\n\nScript Integrity in CI/CD Pipelines:\n\n- Implementation: Integrate code signing into CI/CD pipelines to sign and verify code artifacts before production release.\n- Use Case: A software company ensures that all production builds are signed, preventing tampered builds from reaching customers.\n\n**Key Components of Code Signing**\n\n- Digital Signature Verification: Verifies the authenticity of code by ensuring it was signed by a trusted entity.\n- Certificate Management: Uses Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to manage signing certificates and revocation lists.\n- Enforced Policy for Unsigned Code: Prevents the execution of unsigned or untrusted binaries and scripts.\n- Hash Integrity Check: Confirms that code has not been altered since signing by comparing cryptographic hashes.\n",

This includes protecting data formats indicative of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), intellectual property, or financial data from unauthorized access, transmission, or exfiltration. DLP solutions integrate with network, endpoint, and cloud platforms to enforce security policies and prevent accidental or malicious data leaks. (Citation: PurpleSec Data Loss Prevention) This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nSensitive Data Categorization:\n\n- Use Case: Identify and classify data based on sensitivity (e.g., PII, financial data, trade secrets).\n- Implementation: Use DLP solutions to scan and tag files containing sensitive information using predefined patterns, such as Social Security Numbers or credit card details.\n\nExfiltration Restrictions:\n\n- Use Case: Prevent unauthorized transmission of sensitive data.\n- Implementation: Enforce policies to block unapproved email attachments, unauthorized USB usage, or unencrypted data uploads to cloud storage.\n\nData-in-Transit Monitoring:\n\n- Use Case: Detect and prevent the transmission of sensitive data over unapproved channels.\n- Implementation: Deploy network-based DLP tools to inspect outbound traffic for sensitive content (e.g., financial records or PII) and block unapproved transmissions.\n\nEndpoint Data Protection:\n\n- Use Case: Monitor and control sensitive data usage on endpoints.\n- Implementation: Use endpoint-based DLP agents to block copy-paste actions of sensitive data and unauthorized printing or file sharing.\n\nCloud Data Security:\n\n- Use Case: Protect data stored in cloud platforms.\n- Implementation: Integrate DLP with cloud storage platforms like Google Drive, OneDrive, or AWS to monitor and restrict sensitive data sharing or downloads.",

    "name": "Do Not Mitigate",
    "description": "The Do Not Mitigate category highlights scenarios where attempting to mitigate a specific technique may inadvertently increase the organization's security risk or operational instability. This could happen due to the complexity of the system, the integration of critical processes, or the potential for introducing new vulnerabilities. Instead of direct mitigation, these situations may call for alternative strategies such as detection, monitoring, or response. The Do Not Mitigate category underscores the importance of assessing the trade-offs between mitigation efforts and overall system integrity. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nComplex Systems Where Mitigation is Risky:\n\n- Interpretation: In certain systems, direct mitigation could introduce new risks, especially if the system is highly interconnected or complex, such as in legacy industrial control systems (ICS). Patching or modifying these systems could result in unplanned downtime, disruptions, or even safety risks.\n- Use Case: In a power grid control system, attempting to patch or disable certain services related to device communications might disrupt critical operations, leading to unintended service outages.\n\nRisk of Reducing Security Coverage:\n\n- Interpretation: In some cases, mitigating a technique might reduce the visibility or effectiveness of other security controls, limiting an organization\u2019s ability to detect broader attacks.\n- Use Case: Disabling script execution on a web server to mitigate potential PowerShell-based attacks could interfere with legitimate administrative operations that rely on scripting, while attackers may still find alternate ways to execute code.\n\nIntroduction of New Vulnerabilities:\n\n- Interpretation: In highly sensitive or tightly controlled environments, implementing certain mitigations might create vulnerabilities in other parts of the system. For instance, disabling default security mechanisms in an attempt to resolve compatibility issues may open the system to exploitation.\n- Use Case: Disabling certificate validation to resolve internal communication issues in a secure environment could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, creating a greater vulnerability than the original problem.\n\nNegative Impact on Performance and Availability:\n\n- Interpretation: Mitigations that involve removing or restricting system functionalities can have unintended consequences for system performance and availability. Some mitigations, while effective at blocking certain attacks, may introduce performance bottlenecks or compromise essential operations.\n- Use Case: Implementing high levels of encryption to mitigate data theft might result in significant performance degradation in systems handling large volumes of real-time transactions.",

These activities focus on reducing an organization's attack surface, identify adversarial preparation efforts, and increase the difficulty for attackers to conduct successful operations. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nLimit Information Exposure:\n\n- Regularly audit and sanitize publicly available data, including job posts, websites, and social media.\n- Use tools like OSINT monitoring platforms (e.g., SpiderFoot, Recon-ng) to identify leaked information.\n\nProtect Domain and DNS Infrastructure:\n\n- Enable DNSSEC and use WHOIS privacy protection.\n- Monitor for domain hijacking or lookalike domains using services like RiskIQ or DomainTools.\n\nExternal Monitoring:\n\n- Use tools like Shodan, Censys to monitor your external attack surface.\n- Deploy external vulnerability scanners to proactively address weaknesses.\n\nThreat Intelligence:\n\n- Leverage platforms like MISP, Recorded Future, or Anomali to track adversarial infrastructure, tools, and activity.\n\nContent and Email Protections:\n\n- Use email security solutions like Proofpoint, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, or Mimecast.\n- Enforce SPF/DKIM/DMARC policies to protect against email spoofing.\n\nTraining and Awareness:\n\n- Educate employees on identifying phishing attempts, securing their social media, and avoiding information leaks.",

Ensure all browsers and plugins kept updated can help prevent the exploit phase of this technique.\n\nFor malicious code served up through ads, adblockers can help prevent that code from executing in the first place. Script blocking extensions can help prevent the execution of JavaScript that may commonly be used during the exploitation process.\n\nBrowser sandboxes can be used to mitigate some of the impact of exploitation, but sandbox escapes may still exist.

This mitigation focuses on leveraging secure boot mechanisms, hardware-rooted trust, and runtime integrity checks to prevent tampering during the boot sequence. It is designed to thwart adversaries attempting to modify system firmware, bootloaders, or critical OS components. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nImplementation of Secure Boot:\n\n- Implementation: Enable UEFI Secure Boot on all systems and configure it to allow only signed bootloaders and operating systems.\n- Use Case: An adversary attempts to replace the system\u2019s bootloader with a malicious version to gain persistence. Secure Boot prevents the untrusted bootloader from executing, halting the attack.\n\nUtilization of TPMs:\n\n- Implementation: Configure systems to use TPM-based attestation for boot integrity, ensuring that any modification to the firmware, bootloader, or OS is detected.\n- Use Case: A compromised firmware component alters the boot sequence. The TPM detects the change and triggers an alert, allowing the organization to respond before further damage.\n\nEnable Bootloader Passwords:\n\n- Implementation: Protect BIOS/UEFI settings with a strong password and limit physical access to devices.\n- Use Case: An attacker with physical access attempts to disable Secure Boot or modify the boot sequence. The password prevents unauthorized changes.\n\nRuntime Integrity Monitoring:\n\n- Implementation: Deploy solutions to verify the integrity of critical files and processes after boot.\n- Use Case: A malware infection modifies kernel modules post-boot.

By segmenting networks, organizations can reduce the attack surface, restrict lateral movement by adversaries, and protect critical assets from compromise.\n\nEffective network segmentation leverages a combination of physical boundaries, logical separation through VLANs, and access control policies enforced by network appliances like firewalls, routers, and cloud-based configurations. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nSegment Critical Systems:\n\n- Identify and group systems based on their function, sensitivity, and risk. Examples include payment systems, HR databases, production systems, and internet-facing servers.\n- Use VLANs, firewalls, or routers to enforce logical separation.\n\nImplement DMZ for Public-Facing Services:\n\n- Host web servers, DNS servers, and email servers in a DMZ to limit their access to internal systems.\n- Apply strict firewall rules to filter traffic between the DMZ and internal networks.\n\nUse Cloud-Based Segmentation:\n\n- In cloud environments, use VPCs, subnets, and security groups to isolate applications and enforce traffic rules.\n- Apply AWS Transit Gateway or Azure VNet peering for controlled connectivity between cloud segments.\n\nApply Microsegmentation for Workloads:\n\n- Use software-defined networking (SDN) tools to implement workload-level segmentation and prevent lateral movement.\n\nRestrict Traffic with ACLs and Firewalls:\n\n- Apply Access Control Lists (ACLs) to network devices to enforce \"deny by default\" policies.\n- Use firewalls to restrict both north-south (external-internal) and east-west (internal-internal) traffic.\n\nMonitor and Audit Segmented Networks:\n\n- Regularly review firewall rules, ACLs, and segmentation policies.\n- Monitor network flows for anomalies to ensure segmentation is effective.\n\nTest Segmentation Effectiveness:\n\n- Perform periodic penetration tests to verify that unauthorized access is blocked between network segments.",

    "description": "Set and enforce secure password policies for accounts to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access. Strong password policies include enforcing password complexity, requiring regular password changes, and preventing password reuse. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nWindows Systems:\n\n- Use Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) to configure:\n    - Minimum password length (e.g., 12+ characters).\n    - Password complexity requirements.\n    - Password history (e.g., disallow last 24 passwords).\n    - Account lockout duration and thresholds.\n\nLinux Systems:\n\n- Configure Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM):\n- Use `pam_pwquality` to enforce complexity and length requirements.\n- Implement `pam_tally2` or `pam_faillock` for account lockouts.\n- Use `pwunconv` to disable password reuse.\n\nPassword Managers:\n\n- Enforce usage of enterprise password managers (e.g., Bitwarden, 1Password, LastPass) to generate and store strong passwords.\n\nPassword Blacklisting:\n\n- Use tools like Have I Been Pwned password checks or NIST-based blacklist solutions to prevent users from setting compromised passwords.\n\nRegular Auditing:\n\n- Periodically audit password policies and account configurations to ensure compliance using tools like LAPS (Local Admin Password Solution) and vulnerability scanners.\n\n*Tools for Implementation*\n\nWindows:\n\n- Group Policy Management Console (GPMC): Enforce password policies.\n- Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS): Enforce random, unique admin passwords.\n\nLinux/macOS:\n\n- PAM Modules (pam_pwquality, pam_tally2, pam_faillock): Enforce password rules.\n- Lynis: Audit password policies and system configurations.\n\nCross-Platform:\n\n- Password Managers (Bitwarden, 1Password, KeePass): Manage and enforce strong passwords.\n- Have I Been Pwned API: Prevent the use of breached passwords.\n- NIST SP 800-63B compliant tools: Enforce password guidelines and blacklisting.",

    "name": "Behavior Prevention on Endpoint",
    "description": "Behavior Prevention on Endpoint refers to the use of technologies and strategies to detect and block potentially malicious activities by analyzing the behavior of processes, files, API calls, and other endpoint events. Rather than relying solely on known signatures, this approach leverages heuristics, machine learning, and real-time monitoring to identify anomalous patterns indicative of an attack. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nSuspicious Process Behavior:\n\n- Implementation: Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to monitor and block processes exhibiting unusual behavior, such as privilege escalation attempts.\n- Use Case: An attacker uses a known vulnerability to spawn a privileged process from a user-level application. The endpoint tool detects the abnormal parent-child process relationship and blocks the action.\n\nUnauthorized File Access:\n\n- Implementation: Leverage Data Loss Prevention (DLP) or endpoint tools to block processes attempting to access sensitive files without proper authorization.\n- Use Case: A process tries to read or modify a sensitive file located in a restricted directory, such as /etc/shadow on Linux or the SAM registry hive on Windows. The endpoint tool identifies this anomalous behavior and prevents it.\n\nAbnormal API Calls:\n\n- Implementation: Implement runtime analysis tools to monitor API calls and block those associated with malicious activities.\n- Use Case: A process dynamically injects itself into another process to hijack its execution. The endpoint detects the abnormal use of APIs like `OpenProcess` and `WriteProcessMemory` and terminates the offending process.\n\nExploit Prevention:\n\n- Implementation: Use behavioral exploit prevention tools to detect and block exploits attempting to gain unauthorized access.\n- Use Case: A buffer overflow exploit is launched against a vulnerable application. The endpoint detects the anomalous memory write operation and halts the process.",

Proper account management reduces the attack surface by limiting unauthorized access, managing account privileges, and ensuring accounts are used according to organizational policies. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nEnforcing the Principle of Least Privilege\n\n- Implementation: Assign users only the minimum permissions required to perform their job functions. Regularly audit accounts to ensure no excess permissions are granted.\n- Use Case: Reduces the risk of privilege escalation by ensuring accounts cannot perform unauthorized actions.\n\nImplementing Strong Password Policies\n\n- Implementation: Enforce password complexity requirements (e.g., length, character types). Require password expiration every 90 days and disallow password reuse.\n- Use Case: Prevents adversaries from gaining unauthorized access through password guessing or brute force attacks.\n\nManaging Dormant and Orphaned Accounts\n\n- Implementation: Implement automated workflows to disable accounts after a set period of inactivity (e.g., 30 days). Remove orphaned accounts (e.g., accounts without an assigned owner) during regular account audits.\n- Use Case: Eliminates dormant accounts that could be exploited by attackers.\n\nAccount Lockout Policies\n\n- Implementation: Configure account lockout thresholds (e.g., lock accounts after five failed login attempts). Set lockout durations to a minimum of 15 minutes.\n- Use Case: Mitigates automated attack techniques that rely on repeated login attempts.\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) for High-Risk Accounts\n\n- Implementation: Require MFA for all administrative accounts and high-risk users. Use MFA mechanisms like hardware tokens, authenticator apps, or biometrics.\n- Use Case: Prevents unauthorized access, even if credentials are stolen.\n\nRestricting Interactive Logins\n\n- Implementation: Restrict interactive logins for privileged accounts to specific secure systems or management consoles. Use group policies to enforce logon restrictions.\n- Use Case: Protects sensitive accounts from misuse or exploitation.\n\n*Tools for Implementation*\n\nBuilt-in Tools:\n\n- Microsoft Active Directory (AD): Centralized account management and RBAC enforcement.\n- Group Policy Object (GPO): Enforce password policies, logon restrictions, and account lockout policies.\n\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) Tools:\n\n- Okta: Centralized user provisioning, MFA, and SSO integration.\n- Microsoft Azure Active Directory: Provides advanced account lifecycle management, role-based access, and conditional access policies.\n\nPrivileged Account Management (PAM):\n- CyberArk, BeyondTrust, Thycotic: Manage and monitor privileged account usage, enforce session recording, and JIT access.",

By configuring permissions appropriately, organizations can reduce the attack surface for adversaries seeking to access sensitive data, plant malicious code, or tamper with system files.\n\nEnforce Least Privilege Permissions:\n\n- Remove unnecessary write permissions on sensitive files and directories.\n- Use file ownership and groups to control access for specific roles.\n\nExample (Windows): Right-click the shared folder \u2192 Properties \u2192 Security tab \u2192 Adjust permissions for NTFS ACLs.\n\nHarden File Shares:\n\n- Disable anonymous access to shared folders.\n- Enforce NTFS permissions for shared folders on Windows.\n\nExample: Set permissions to restrict write access to critical files, such as system executables (e.g., `/bin` or `/sbin` on Linux). Use tools like `chown` and `chmod` to assign file ownership and limit access.\n\nOn Linux, apply:\n`chmod 750 /etc/sensitive.conf`\n`chown root:admin /etc/sensitive.conf`\n\nFile Integrity Monitoring (FIM):\n\n- Use tools like Tripwire, Wazuh, or OSSEC to monitor changes to critical file permissions.\n\nAudit File System Access:\n\n- Enable auditing to track permission changes or unauthorized access attempts.\n- Use auditd (Linux) or Event Viewer (Windows) to log activities.\n\nRestrict Startup Directories:\n\n- Configure permissions to prevent unauthorized writes to directories like `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu`.\n\nExample: Restrict write access to critical directories like `/etc/`, `/usr/local/`, and Windows directories such as `C:\\Windows\\System32`.\n\n- On Windows, use icacls to modify permissions: `icacls \"C:\\Windows\\System32\" /inheritance:r /grant:r SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)F`\n- On Linux, monitor permissions using tools like `lsattr` or `auditd`.",

    "description": "Antivirus/Antimalware solutions utilize signatures, heuristics, and behavioral analysis to detect, block, and remediate malicious software, including viruses, trojans, ransomware, and spyware. These solutions continuously monitor endpoints and systems for known malicious patterns and suspicious behaviors that indicate compromise. Antivirus/Antimalware software should be deployed across all devices, with automated updates to ensure protection against the latest threats. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nSignature-Based Detection:\n\n- Implementation: Use predefined signatures to identify known malware based on unique patterns such as file hashes, byte sequences, or command-line arguments. This method is effective against known threats.\n- Use Case: When malware like \"Emotet\" is detected, its signature (such as a specific file hash) matches a known database of malicious software, triggering an alert and allowing immediate quarantine of the infected file.\n\nHeuristic-Based Detection:\n\n- Implementation: Deploy heuristic algorithms that analyze behavior and characteristics of files and processes to identify potential malware, even if it doesn\u2019t match a known signature.\n- Use Case: If a program attempts to modify multiple critical system files or initiate suspicious network communications, heuristic analysis may flag it as potentially malicious, even if no specific malware signature is available.\n\nBehavioral Detection (Behavior Prevention):\n\n- Implementation: Use behavioral analysis to detect patterns of abnormal activities, such as unusual system calls, unauthorized file encryption, or attempts to escalate privileges.\n- Use Case: Behavioral analysis can detect ransomware attacks early by identifying behavior like mass file encryption, even before a specific ransomware signature has been identified.\n\nReal-Time Scanning:\n\n- Implementation: Enable real-time scanning to automatically inspect files and network traffic for signs of malware as they are accessed, downloaded, or executed.\n- Use Case: When a user downloads an email attachment, the antivirus solution scans the file in real-time, checking it against both signatures and heuristics to detect any malicious content before it can be opened.\n\nCloud-Assisted Threat Intelligence:\n\n- Implementation: Use cloud-based threat intelligence to ensure the antivirus solution can access the latest malware definitions and real-time threat feeds from a global database of emerging threats.\n- Use Case: Cloud-assisted antivirus solutions quickly identify newly discovered malware by cross-referencing against global threat databases, providing real-time protection against zero-day attacks.\n\n**Tools for Implementation**:\n\n- Endpoint Security Platforms: Use solutions such as EDR for comprehensive antivirus/antimalware protection across all systems.\n- Centralized Management: Implement centralized antivirus management consoles that provide visibility into threat activity, enable policy enforcement, and automate updates.\n- Behavioral Analysis Tools: Leverage solutions with advanced behavioral analysis capabilities to detect malicious activity patterns that don\u2019t rely on known signatures.",

These factors typically include:\n\n- *Something you know*: Passwords, PINs.\n- *Something you have*: Physical tokens, smartphone authenticator apps.\n- *Something you are*: Biometric data such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or retinal scans.\n\nImplementing MFA across all critical systems and services ensures robust protection against account takeover and unauthorized access. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM):\n\n- Use IAM solutions like Azure Active Directory, Okta, or AWS IAM to enforce MFA policies for all user logins, especially for privileged roles.\n- Enable conditional access policies to enforce MFA for risky sign-ins (e.g., unfamiliar devices, geolocations).\n\nAuthentication Tools and Methods:\n\n- Use authenticator applications such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Authy for time-based one-time passwords (TOTP).\n- Deploy hardware-based tokens like YubiKey, RSA SecurID, or smart cards for additional security.\n- Enforce biometric authentication for compatible devices and applications.\n\nSecure Legacy Systems:\n\n- Integrate MFA solutions with older systems using third-party tools like Duo Security or Thales SafeNet.\n- Enable RADIUS/NPS servers to facilitate MFA for VPNs, RDP, and other network logins.\n\nMonitoring and Alerting:\n\n- Use SIEM tools to monitor failed MFA attempts, login anomalies, or brute-force attempts against MFA systems.\n- Implement alerts for suspicious MFA activities, such as repeated failed codes or new device registrations.\n\nTraining and Policy Enforcement:\n\n- Educate employees on the importance of MFA and secure authenticator usage.\n- Enforce policies that require MFA on all critical systems, especially for remote access, privileged accounts, and cloud applications.",

    "description": "Clean up SID-History attributes after legitimate account migration is complete.\n\nConsider applying SID Filtering to interforest trusts, such as forest trusts and external trusts, to exclude SID-History from requests to access domain resources. SID Filtering ensures that any authentication requests over a trust only contain SIDs of security principals from the trusted domain (i.e. preventing the trusted domain from claiming a user has membership in groups outside of the domain).\n\nSID Filtering of forest trusts is enabled by default, but may have been disabled in some cases to allow a child domain to transitively access forest trusts. SID Filtering of external trusts is automatically enabled on all created external trusts using Server 2003 or later domain controllers. (Citation: Microsoft Trust Considerations Nov 2014) (Citation: Microsoft SID Filtering Quarantining Jan 2009) However note that SID Filtering is not automatically applied to legacy trusts or may have been deliberately disabled to allow inter-domain access to resources.\n\nSID Filtering can be applied by: (Citation: Microsoft Netdom Trust Sept 2012)\n\n* Disabling SIDHistory on forest trusts using the netdom tool (<code>netdom trust <TrustingDomainName> /domain:<TrustedDomainName> /EnableSIDHistory:no</code> on the domain controller). \n* Applying SID Filter Quarantining to external trusts using the netdom tool (<code>netdom trust <TrustingDomainName> /domain:<TrustedDomainName> /quarantine:yes</code> on the domain controller)\nApplying SID Filtering to domain trusts within a single forest is not recommended as it is an unsupported configuration and can cause breaking changes. (Citation: Microsoft Netdom Trust Sept 2012) (Citation: AdSecurity Kerberos GT Aug 2015) If a domain within a forest is untrustworthy then it should not be a member of the forest. In this situation it is necessary to first split the trusted and untrusted domains into separate forests where SID Filtering can be applied to an interforest trust.",

This method prevents potentially malicious code from affecting the rest of the system or network by limiting access to sensitive resources and critical operations. The goal is to contain threats and minimize their impact. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nBrowser Sandboxing:\n\n- Use Case: Implement browser sandboxing to isolate untrusted web content, preventing malicious web pages or scripts from accessing sensitive system files.\n- Implementation: Use tools like Google Chrome's built-in sandbox or deploy solutions like Bromium to secure user web interactions.\n\nApplication Virtualization:\n\n- Use Case: Deploy critical or high-risk applications in a virtualized environment to ensure any compromise does not affect the host system.\n- Implementation: Use application virtualization platforms to run applications in isolated environments.\n\nEmail Attachment Sandboxing:\n\n- Use Case: Route email attachments to a sandbox environment to detect and block malware before delivering emails to end-users.\n- Implementation: Integrate security solutions with sandbox capabilities to analyze email attachments.\n\nEndpoint Sandboxing:\n\n- Use Case: Run all downloaded files and applications in a restricted environment to monitor their behavior for malicious activity.\n- Implementation: Use endpoint protection tools for sandboxing at the endpoint level.",

However, there are potential mitigations. Users can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing emails with malicious links. To prevent the downloads from executing, application whitelisting can be used. Anti-virus can also automatically quarantine suspicious files.",

The primary purpose of auditing is to detect anomalies and identify potential threats or weaknesses in the environment. Proper auditing configurations can also help to meet compliance requirements. The process of auditing encompasses regular analysis of user behaviors and system logs in support of proactive security measures.\n\nAuditing is applicable to all systems used within an organization, from the front door of a building to accessing a file on a fileserver. It is considered more critical for regulated industries such as, healthcare, finance and government where compliance requirements demand stringent tracking of user and system activates.This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures: \n\nSystem Audit:\n\n- Use Case: Regularly assess system configurations to ensure compliance with organizational security policies.\n- Implementation: Use tools to scan for deviations from established benchmarks.\n\nPermission Audits:\n\n- Use Case: Review file and folder permissions to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.\n- Implementation: Run access reviews to identify users or groups with excessive permissions.\n\nSoftware Audits:\n\n- Use Case: Identify outdated, unsupported, or insecure software that could serve as an attack vector.\n- Implementation: Use inventory and vulnerability scanning tools to detect outdated versions and recommend secure alternatives.\n\nConfiguration Audits:\n\n- Use Case: Evaluate system and network configurations to ensure secure settings (e.g., disabled SMBv1, enabled MFA).\n- Implementation: Implement automated configuration scanning tools like SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) to identify non-compliant systems.\n\nNetwork Audits:\n\n- Use Case: Examine network traffic, firewall rules, and endpoint communications to identify unauthorized or insecure connections.\n- Implementation: Utilize tools such as Wireshark, or Zeek to monitor and log suspicious network behavior.",

AD configurations enable centralized control over account settings, logon policies, and permissions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nAccount Configuration:\n\n- Implementation: Use domain accounts instead of local accounts to leverage AD\u2019s centralized management, including group policies, auditing, and access control.\n- Use Case: For IT staff managing shared resources, provision domain accounts that allow IT teams to log in centrally, reducing the risk of unmanaged, rogue local accounts on individual machines.\n\nInteractive Logon Restrictions:\n\n- Implementation: Configure group policies to restrict interactive logons (e.g., direct physical or RDP logons) for service accounts or privileged accounts that do not require such access.\n- Use Case: Prevent service accounts, such as SQL Server accounts, from having interactive logon privileges. This reduces the risk of these accounts being leveraged for lateral movement if compromised.\n\nRemote Desktop Settings:\n\n- Implementation: Limit Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to specific, authorized accounts. Use group policies to enforce this, allowing only necessary users to establish RDP sessions.\n- Use Case: On sensitive servers (e.g., domain controllers or financial databases), restrict RDP access to administrative accounts only, while all other users are denied access.\n\nDedicated Administrative Accounts:\n\n- Implementation: Create domain-wide administrative accounts that are restricted from interactive logons, designed solely for high-level tasks (e.g., software installation, patching).\n- Use Case: Create separate administrative accounts for different purposes, such as one set of accounts for installations and another for managing repository access. This limits exposure and helps reduce attack vectors.\n\nAuthentication Silos:\n\n- Implementation: Configure Authentication Silos in AD, using group policies to create access zones with restrictions based on membership, such as the Protected Users security group. This restricts access to critical accounts and minimizes exposure to potential threats.\n- Use Case: Place high-risk or high-value accounts, such as executive or administrative accounts, in an Authentication Silo with extra controls, limiting their exposure to only necessary systems. This reduces the risk of credential misuse or abuse if these accounts are compromised.\n\n**Tools for Implementation**:\n\n- Active Directory Group Policies: Use Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) to configure, deploy, and enforce policies across AD environments.\n- PowerShell: Automate account configuration, logon restrictions, and policy application using PowerShell scripts.\n- AD Administrative Center: Manage Authentication Silos and configure high-level policies for critical user groups within AD.",

    "name": "Account Use Policies",
    "description": "Account Use Policies help mitigate unauthorized access by configuring and enforcing rules that govern how and when accounts can be used. These policies include enforcing account lockout mechanisms, restricting login times, and setting inactivity timeouts. Proper configuration of these policies reduces the risk of brute-force attacks, credential theft, and unauthorized access by limiting the opportunities for malicious actors to exploit accounts. This mitigation can be implemented through the following measures:\n\nAccount Lockout Policies:\n\n- Implementation: Configure account lockout settings so that after a defined number of failed login attempts (e.g., 3-5 attempts), the account is locked for a specific time period (e.g., 15 minutes) or requires an administrator to unlock it.\n- Use Case: This prevents brute-force attacks by limiting how many incorrect password attempts can be made before the account is temporarily disabled, reducing the likelihood of an attacker successfully guessing a password.\n\nLogin Time Restrictions:\n\n- Implementation: Set up login time policies to restrict when users or groups can log into systems. For example, only allowing login during standard business hours (e.g., 8 AM to 6 PM) for non-administrative accounts.\n- Use Case: This prevents unauthorized access outside of approved working hours, where login attempts might be more suspicious or harder to monitor. For example, if an account that is only supposed to be active during the day logs in at 2 AM, it should raise an alert or be blocked.\n\nInactivity Timeout and Session Termination:\n\n- Implementation: Enforce session timeouts after a period of inactivity (e.g., 10-15 minutes) and require users to re-authenticate if they wish to resume the session.\n- Use Case: This policy prevents attackers from hijacking active sessions left unattended. For example, if an employee walks away from their computer without locking it, an attacker with physical access to the system would be unable to exploit the session.\n\nPassword Aging Policies:\n\n- Implementation: Enforce password aging rules, requiring users to change their passwords after a defined period (e.g., 90 days) and ensure passwords are not reused by maintaining a password history.\n- Use Case: This limits the risk of compromised passwords being used indefinitely. Regular password changes make it more difficult for attackers to reuse stolen credentials.\n\nAccount Expiration and Deactivation:\n\n- Implementation: Configure user accounts, especially for temporary or contract workers, to automatically expire after a set date or event. Accounts that remain unused for a specific period should be deactivated automatically.\n- Use Case: This prevents dormant accounts from becoming an attack vector. For example, an attacker can exploit unused accounts if they are not properly monitored or deactivated.\n\n**Tools for Implementation**:\n\n- Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in Windows: To enforce account lockout thresholds, login time restrictions, session timeouts, and password policies.\n- Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions: For centralized management of user accounts, session policies, and automated deactivation of accounts.\n- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms: To monitor and alert on unusual login activity, such as failed logins or out-of-hours access attempts.\n- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Tools: To further enforce secure login attempts, preventing brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.\n",
