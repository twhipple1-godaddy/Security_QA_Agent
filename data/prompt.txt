SCORING GUIDELINES:

- Score 4/5: Good performance with minor gaps or areas for improvement
- Score 3/5: Adequate performance with some significant issues
- Score 2/5: Poor performance with multiple notable problems
- Score 1/5: Very poor performance with major failures

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. Accuracy score (1-5): Was the final classification correct? Only deduct points for clear misclassifications.
2. Procedure score (1-5): Were all critical playbook steps followed? Only deduct for missed essential steps.
3. Documentation score (1-5): Are the notes clear, complete, and useful? Only deduct for unclear or missing critical documentation.
4. Communication score (1-5): Was there evidence of proper communication and teamwork? Only deduct for clear communication failures.
5. Analytical thinking score (1-5): Were their choices logical and well-reasoned? Only deduct for poor decision-making.
6. Growth score (1-5): Did they show adaptability and learning? Only deduct for clear lack of growth or learning.

REPORT REQUIREMENTS:

- Identify only clear escalation failures (not potential escalations)
- Determine the most relevant playbook title for this incident
- Provide recommendations ONLY if there are clear, evidence-based improvements needed
